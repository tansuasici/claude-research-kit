<p align="center">Drop-in templates that make Claude Code behave like a rigorous co-author instead of an eager intern — for scholarly writing in LaTeX&nbsp;+&nbsp;BibTeX.</p>

## The Problem

Out of the box, Claude Code writes *fluent* academic prose — which is exactly the danger. It will:
- Invent a citation, DOI, author, or page number that looks real but isn't
- State a statistic or measured value it doesn't actually have
- Overclaim — "causes" where the evidence only licenses "is associated with"
- Drift off the thesis and pad sections with plausible filler
- Quote a source it never read, with no locator

In code, a hallucination breaks the build and you find out. In a manuscript, a hallucinated citation **looks correct** — and survives to peer review, or print.

## The Solution

This kit provides a `CLAUDE.md` instruction set, **deterministic hooks**, review agents, and skills that enforce one discipline:

**Question → Evidence → Draft → Verify → Cite** — every time.

The cardinal rule the whole kit exists to enforce: **every claim traces to a real source; never invent a citation, DOI, quote, or quantity; never overclaim beyond the evidence.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# clone into your manuscript repo
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/tansuasici/ClaudeResearchKit.git /tmp/crk
cp /tmp/crk/kit/CLAUDE.md /tmp/crk/kit/MANUSCRIPT_MAP.md /tmp/crk/kit/CLAUDE.project.md .
cp -r /tmp/crk/kit/.claude /tmp/crk/kit/agent_docs /tmp/crk/kit/tasks .
rm -rf /tmp/crk
```

Then **fill in `MANUSCRIPT_MAP.md`** with your thesis, contribution, target venue, and section plan — it is the single most important file, read first every session — and start a Claude Code session.

> npx (`crk init`) and the Claude Code plugin marketplace listing are planned; see the roadmap at the bottom.

## What CLAUDE.md Enforces

| Rule | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Tiered Session Boot** | Loads the manuscript map, thesis, venue, and active task first — not the whole corpus |
| **Source-Grounded Writing** | The cardinal rule: no invented citations, DOIs, quotes, or quantities — ever |
| **Claim Discipline** | Every sentence is cited, the author's own argument, or common knowledge — nothing else |
| **Protected Claims** | Stops for approval before changing the thesis, a reported number, methods, or an argument-bearing citation |
| **Verification** | Citations resolve → quotes match → claims supported → numbers consistent → cross-refs → compiles |
| **Calibrated Language** | Matches verbs and quantifiers to what the evidence licenses (`suggests` ≠ `proves`) |
| **Reviewer Memory** | Logs recurring reviewer feedback to `tasks/reviews/` and reviews the Top Rules each session |

## Hooks

Hooks are shell scripts that run automatically — unlike CLAUDE.md rules (advisory), hooks are **deterministic**. The kit ships **10** hooks, all wired by default.

**Guardrails — block on violation (PreToolUse / Stop):**

| Hook | Event | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| `block-fabrication` | PreToolUse | Blocks writing a fabricated reference — placeholder/fake-shaped DOIs (`10.xxxx`, `example.com`) and empty required `.bib` fields. Honest prose placeholders (`[CITE]`) are never blocked |
| `protect-sources` | PreToolUse | Blocks edits to `sources/` (raw evidence), `data/raw/`, and frozen `submitted/` snapshots |
| `branch-protect` | PreToolUse | Blocks push to `main`/`master` and force pushes |
| `block-dangerous-commands` | PreToolUse | Blocks `rm -rf /`, `git reset --hard`, etc. |
| `citation-gate` | PostToolUse | After a `.tex`/`.bib` edit: every `\cite` must resolve in `references.bib`; every `\ref` must have a `\label`. Records the verdict |
| `stop-gate` | Stop | Blocks completion when the last citation gate failed (bypass: `SKIP_QUALITY_GATE=1`) |

**Context & observability — inject or warn, never block:**

| Hook | Event | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| `session-start` | SessionStart | Injects the manuscript-map pointer, thesis, stage, top reviewer rules, active task, branch + dirty tree; resets stale session state |
| `prompt-router` | UserPromptSubmit | Injects a calibration reminder when a prompt touches an inflection (overclaim, statistics, causation, citations, reviewer response, methods) |
| `unicode-scan` | PostToolUse | Detects invisible Unicode (rife in copy-pasted PDF text) |
| `session-end` | SessionEnd | Writes a session audit line for the scorecard |

> The `RESEARCH_APPROVED=1` escape hatch bypasses `protect-sources` and `block-fabrication` (e.g. importing a `.bib` you have independently verified).

### ResearchKitBench — the hooks are tested

The hooks aren't documentation, they're a contract. The kit ships [`bench/`](bench/README.md): a reproducible eval harness with **24 deterministic scenarios** (no LLM, no network) covering every blocking hook, plus regressions (a `\cite` inside a TeX comment must not count; honest `[CITE]` prose placeholders must not be blocked). Run it with `./scripts/run-bench.sh`; CI runs it on every PR (ubuntu + macOS).

## Agents

Built-in reviewers (Reasoner-tier) for pre-submission rigor:

| Agent | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `peer-reviewer` | Simulates a tough-but-fair Reviewer 2 — novelty, soundness, claim↔evidence support, recommendation |
| `integrity-reviewer` | Research-integrity scan — overclaim, p-hacking/HARKing, citation misuse, missing limitations |
| `fact-checker` | Claim-by-claim verification against sources — Supported / Overstated / Unsupported / Uncited |
| `outline-planner` | Turns a thesis into a claim-driven IMRaD outline with evidence + word budgets |

## Skills

User-invocable — run with `/skill-name`:

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/claim-check` | Walks every claim, classifies cited / own / unsupported, checks the citation licenses the verb |
| `/citation-audit` | Bibliography health — dangling cites, orphan entries, malformed DOIs, `\ref`↔`\label` |
| `/peer-review` | Full simulated referee report (runs peer-reviewer + integrity-reviewer) |
| `/outline` | Thesis → claim-driven IMRaD outline ready for `MANUSCRIPT_MAP.md` |
| `/journal-fit` | Assesses fit to a target venue — scope, novelty bar, length, reference style |
| `/response-to-reviewers` | Point-by-point response letter — quote, change, location, never claim an unmade change |
| `/literature-review` | Synthesize related work from your own library (`.bib` + `sources/` + vault); thematic, gap-driven, real citations only; proposes search directions for gaps |
| `/abstract` | Draft/tighten the abstract — every number must match the body, calibrated to the venue's limit |
| `/stats-check` | Run the statistics checklist — effect size + CI, N, test; flags causal overclaim and p-hacking |
| `/methods-review` | Reproducibility check of the methods — flags every missing ingredient to reproduce |
| `/gap-finder` | Breadth-first scan for uncited/unsupported claims; proposes search directions for true gaps |
| `/cover-letter` | Editor cover letter from `MANUSCRIPT_MAP` — contribution, fit, no fabricated significance |
| `/reference-format` | Convert citation style deterministically (biber/CSL); never invents a missing field |
| `/plain-language-summary` | Lay summary that stays faithful — simpler wording never becomes a stronger claim |

## Field Overlays

The analogue of stack templates — discipline-specific conventions that supplement the general docs:

| Overlay | Covers |
|---------|--------|
| `agent_docs/field/ai-ml.md` | ML/NLP venue cues (NeurIPS/ICML/ACL/EMNLP), reproducibility (seeds, compute, decoding params), baselines & ablations, significance over seeds, eval contamination, LLM-agent reviewer concerns |

## Literature Vault (module)

An incremental, interlinked **annotated bibliography** — the evidence layer the cardinal rule depends on ("every claim traces to a real source" is only as strong as how well your sources are organized). Based on the Karpathy LLM-wiki pattern: Claude builds and maintains the vault from your raw sources, self-contained and offline.

- `sources/` holds raw, **immutable** material (PDFs, notes); `vault/` is the maintained knowledge base (`summaries/<bibkey>.md`, `concepts/`, `entities/`).
- `/lit-ingest` reads a source → writes an annotated summary (claims with locators, limitations, quotes) → **proposes the `references.bib` entry from the document itself** (never fabricated) → cross-references concepts/entities.
- `/lit-lint` health-checks (contradictions, orphans, missing locators); `/lit-briefing` reports what's new and what gaps remain vs your thesis; the `vault-maintainer` agent does the heavy work.
- It compounds with `/literature-review` and the `fact-checker` agent, which read the vault for grounded evidence. Schema: [`VAULT.md`](VAULT.md).

```

## Customization

1. **Fill in `MANUSCRIPT_MAP.md`** — thesis, contribution, venue, section budgets, key sources. The more precise, the less the agent drifts.
2. **Add a `STYLE.md`** — your manuscript's voice and formatting source of truth (optional; the agent reads it before drafting).
3. **Customize `CLAUDE.project.md`** — venue constraints (blind review, word limits) that override kit defaults.
4. **Track reviewer feedback** — `tasks/reviews/` compounds over time; recurring critiques become Top Rules.

## Status & Roadmap

**v0.1.0 — foundation.** The deterministic spine (hooks + bench), CLAUDE.md ruleset, 4 agents, 7 skills, 7 agent_docs, and the ai-ml field overlay are in place and bench-proven.

Planned: npx distribution (`crk init` / `doctor` / `convert`), plugin-marketplace listing, more field overlays (life-sciences, social-sciences, CS), `latexmk` compile gating, `texcount` budget hook, more skills (`/abstract`, `/stats-check`, …), and a documentation site.
